This guide explains how to start using a MapsIndoors map in your HTML application.

To benefit from the guides, you will need basic knowledge about:

* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* Google Maps Javascript API V3

## Setting up a map

### Set the MapsIndoors API Key

In order to include MapsIndoors in your app, you need an API key. If you are not a customer you can use this API key `57e4e4992e74800ef8b69718` to follow the guide.

In order to include MapsIndoors in your own app with your own content, you need to [contact MapsPeople](https://resources.mapspeople.com/contact-us) to get your building drawings processed and hosted by us.

You will receive a unique API key to use when access has been granted. If you are exploring how this service can become part of your own product, you can read about [partnering with MapsPeople here](https://www.mapspeople.com/become-a-partner).

### Setup Your HTML

Include the following scripts in your HTML document. MapsIndoors depends on Google Maps API v3, so if itâ€™s not present on script load, MapsIndoors will not be able to initialize.

If you need to use a floor selector (most projects do), just add a css reference as in the sample. This will provide a basic CSS-layout for the floor selector.

```html
{% raw %}<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=geometry&key=MY_GOOGLE_API_KEY"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/VERSION/mapsindoors-VERSION.js.gz?apikey=MY_MAPSINDOORS_API_KEY"></script>
// Load css for default floor selector
<link href="https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/ui/FloorSelector.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />{% endraw %}
```

Replace:

* `MY_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your own Google API key
* `VERSION` with the wanted MapsIndoors version. See our <a href="https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/js/sdk/latest/docs/index.html">Reference Docs</a> for the latest version number. Please note there are two occurrences of `VERSION` to replace in the URL.
* `MY_MAPSINDOORS_API_KEY` with your MapsIndoors API key

As always when setting up Google Maps, create a div with defined width and height.

```html
<div id="map" style="width:600px;height:600px"></div>
```

### Setup JavaScript

Then add the following JavaScript code in a script tag in the top of your HTML page.

```javascript
var myGoogleMap, myMapsIndoors;

var init = function () {

   // Setup Google map
   myGoogleMap = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), { center: { lat: 57.085809, lng: 9.9573899 }, zoom: 17 });

   // Setup MapsIndoors
   myMapsIndoors= new mapsindoors.MapsIndoors({ map: myGoogleMap });

   // Add a floor selector
   var div = document.createElement('div');
   var floorSelector = new mapsindoors.FloorSelector(div, myMapsIndoors);
   myGoogleMap.controls[google.maps.ControlPosition.RIGHT_TOP].push(div);

};

google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', init);
```

## Trying the Showcase Web App

A [showcase app is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsWeb), free to use and adapt to your needs.

### Try the Showcase Web App right away

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js, npm package manager and [Angular CLI globally](https://angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli).

Using a terminal/shell in the project folder, run the following commands:

* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

* Run `npm start` for a dev server and then enter a Solution ID in the URL, e.g. <http://localhost:4200/demo.> The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Live Demo

Check out a running version [here](https://demo.mapsindoors.com/demo).

## Work with MapsIndoors SDK behind a Firewall

If you need to work with MapsIndoors SDK behind a firewall, you might need to [white-list some IP-adresses](../../ip-whitelisting).
